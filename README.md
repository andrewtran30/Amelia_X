# AmeliaX
Amelia X is a fully autonomous virtual homework helper that uses natural language processing and a webscraper to provide students with academic assistance. Through the application, students can sign on, ask Amelia a question, and have recieve a response within seconds. If Amelia (the virtual tutor) fails to find the answer for the student's question, then Amelia will provide external links for the student to search.
